# JSPose - Doing biomechanics was never harder!
## What
This "software" (hastly written js script) will take you picture, biomechanical data about distribution of weights and distances of center of masss of body part from proximal center
and calculate body center of mass. 
## How
Download it as a zip, unpack it, double click on index, open in your webbrowser, upload your image and .json that comes with this repo. In the json, there are already data for testing image,
so you can overwrite them by simply clicking on the row of body part you want to edit, then clicking on the proximal end of the body part on image and then clicking on the distal end. 
After you are satisfied, you can calculate body center of mass, centers of mass for every body part, save .json for later use or export the image by right mouse click to show it in 
different window.
